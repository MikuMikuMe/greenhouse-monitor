# greenhouse-monitor

Creating a comprehensive Python program for a greenhouse monitoring system with IoT sensors and AI-driven analytics requires several components. Below is an example of a simplified version that employs mock data and basic logic. This code can be further expanded with hardware-specific libraries and AI models as needed.

```python
import random
import logging
import time

# Set up logging to file
logging.basicConfig(filename='greenhouse_monitor.log', level=logging.INFO, 
                    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

# Mock function to simulate sensor readings
def read_sensor_data():
    # In a real application, this would interface with hardware sensors
    return {
        'temperature': random.uniform(15.0, 30.0),  # Celsius
        'humidity': random.uniform(30.0, 70.0),     # Percent
        'light': random.uniform(300.0, 800.0)       # Lux
    }

# Simple function to simulate analyzing data
def analyze_data(data):
    recommendations = []

    if data['temperature'] < 18.0:
        recommendations.append('Increase heating')
    elif data['temperature'] > 25.0:
        recommendations.append('Activate cooling system')

    if data['humidity'] < 40.0:
        recommendations.append('Increase humidity')
    elif data['humidity'] > 60.0:
        recommendations.append('Decrease humidity')

    if data['light'] < 400.0:
        recommendations.append('Increase lighting')
    elif data['light'] > 700.0:
        recommendations.append('Dim lighting')

    return recommendations

def main():
    try:
        # Mock continuous monitoring with a loop
        # In a real application, this would likely be event-driven or scheduled
        while True:
            # Read data from sensors
            data = read_sensor_data()
            logging.info(f"Sensor data: {data}")

            # Analyze data to generate recommendations
            recommendations = analyze_data(data)
            logging.info(f"Recommendations: {recommendations}")

            # Simulate taking action based on recommendations
            # In real application, here you would interface with actuators
            for recommendation in recommendations:
                logging.info(f"Action taken: {recommendation}")

            # Wait for the next data read
            time.sleep(10)

    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"An error occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Explanation:

- **Logging**: Keeps a record of sensor data, recommendations, and any actions taken. Helps in debugging and performance analysis. Code logs to a file named `greenhouse_monitor.log`.
  
- **Error Handling**: Wraps the main monitoring loop in a `try-except` block to catch and log any exceptions that might occur during execution.

- **Mock Sensor**: `read_sensor_data()` simulates reading temperature, humidity, and light levels from real sensors.

- **Data Analysis**: `analyze_data(data)` generates basic recommendations based on the sensor data.

- **Main Loop**: Continuously reads sensor data, analyzes it, and logs actions based on hypothetical recommendations. This loop sleeps for 10 seconds between readings to avoid flooding logs and simulate real-time data monitoring.

In a real-world scenario, you would replace the mock sensor reading functions with actual sensor libraries such as `Adafruit_DHT` for temperature and humidity or `TSL2561` for light sensors. Similarly, AI-driven analytics would involve applying trained machine learning models on collected data to optimize recommendations beyond simple threshold checks. This example is conservative and ensures detailed process feedback through logging.
